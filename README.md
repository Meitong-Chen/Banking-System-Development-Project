# Banking System Development Project

## Overview
This repository contains documentation and key achievements from my tenure as a team member from November 2021 to December 2021 on a project focused on developing a comprehensive banking system using C++. The system manages over 10,000 accounts, categorizing them into personal and corporate types, and provides a full range of banking functionalities.

## Contributions

### Banking System Features Development
- **Programming Language**: Utilized C++ to develop the core functionalities of the banking system.
- **Account Management**: Implemented features to manage over 10,000 personal and corporate accounts.
- **Banking Operations**: Enabled operations such as querying account details, depositing funds, transferring amounts between accounts, and borrowing.

### Security and Data Management
- **Password Management**: Established a data system that allows customers to change their initial password and set a personalized password for increased security.
- **Customer Verification**: Enhanced the system's ability to verify customer information against account numbers, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.6%.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Used for all backend development, providing robust performance and security for banking operations.
- **Data Management Systems**: Implemented to handle account information security and customer data verification.

## Setup and Installation
The source code and documentation provided here are primarily for viewing and understanding the project structure and functionalities. To set up a similar system or development environment:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as GCC for Linux or Visual Studio for Windows.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the source files using the makefile provided or through your IDE.

## Usage
- **Compilation**: Use the command `g++ -o bankingSystem main.cpp` (modify according to your source file organization).
- **Execution**: Run the compiled executable to start the banking system simulation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained profound insights into complex system development and data security in banking applications.
- Developed advanced skills in C++ programming, focusing on robust and secure design principles.
